This project is a Java-based facial emotion detection system that identifies human emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral, Surprise, Fear, and more using OpenCV for face detection and a deep learning model for emotion classification. The goal of the project is to combine Java’s object-oriented structure with real-time computer vision to build a fast, scalable, and intelligent application.
